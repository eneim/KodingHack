# Donathon - The Worldwide Donation Application

A place where everyone can be more charitable, and help places where natural disasters occurred from your city.

Made by [Team Gundam](https://github.com/jumpeiymn/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/Gundam/ABOUT.md).

## Description

### What is Donathon?
Donathon is a service that aims to increase the amount of donations to natural disaster relief charities worldwide to improve our precious world. Donathon is also a service where users can easily see real-time disasters, and fundraise/donate them on the spot. Along the way, users can see and meet other people who are just as charitable.

### How do I donate?
