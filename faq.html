      <a name="donathon" class="anchor" href="#donathon"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Donathon?</h3>

      <p>My job was to research and develop an android application for people with reading disabilities. It was to be 
      an improvement from an earlier prototypal concept written in VBA. I participated in every part of the 
      software’s lifecycle.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Research – researched on the rehabilitation of various reading disabilities and wrote a research paper</li>
      <li>Design – Learned VBA in 1 day, reviewed/debugged a prototype of the application in VBA, and decided 
      on which parts to improve/port over to the Android app, and which parts to scrap</li>
      <li>Software Documentation – product requirements, functional specifications, and design specifications</li>
      <li>Development – developed the application on Android with the Eclipse IDE</li>
      <li>Debugging – debugged the application with steps/breaks and logging</li>
      <li>Testing – tested the application side-by-side with an actual user who has a reading disability, among 
      other users (mostly by using LogCat and step/breaks)</li>
